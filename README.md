Dialogflow Webhook for Tasks
======================

A simple webhook for [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) that uses [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/), in Java. Dependencies are handled with gradle. It uses Dialogflow V1 API.

It provides basic support for showing and creating tasks.

Tested with the api.ai project included in the repository (`TaskManager.zip`), by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for having a public address with HTPPS.
